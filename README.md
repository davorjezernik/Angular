## 🚀 Development Server

### 1. Clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/davorjezernik/Angular.git
cd sakura
```

### 2. Check if if u have Node.JS
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
If these commands show version numbers, you’re good to go.
If not, download and install the LTS version from Node.js
, then restart your terminal.

### 3. Install the Angular CLI
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
Verify the installation:
```bash
ng version
```

### 4. Install dependencies

npm install
```

### 5. Install dependencies
```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:
```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:
```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:
```bash
ng build
```
This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:
```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:
```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
